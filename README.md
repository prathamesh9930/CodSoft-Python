#CodSoft-Python
Overview:-
This repository contains the work I completed during my Python Programming internship at CodSoft, where I explored various Python concepts and developed three key projects:

1) Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
2) Contact Book
3) Password Generator

Each task provided hands-on experience with Python programming principles, rule-based logic, game theory, and other techniques.
